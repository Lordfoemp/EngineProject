I have a timer class which holds everything about the time (offcourse). 
But i dont pass my "delta time" in the update to all the objects, components.
At the moment my Timer class is a singleton (which is going to change to locator service),
this way I can access it when I need it like in the FPSComponent.

Question: Is this a good or bad way? Thank you :)
